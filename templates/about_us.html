<div class = "about">
    Climate change has always been a major issue in our society. 
    However, in recent years, the effects of climate change have intensified from worrisome to nearly catastrophic. 
    Ice caps are melting, ozone holes are growing, sea levels are rising, and wildfires are multiplying.
    If we don't start making changes to reduce our carbon footprint and halt global warming, we will be dooming our planet.
    People must start making sustainable choices, and that can start in the kitchen.
    If you have an APP'etite for change, Sustainable Eaternity is here to help.
    Our app allows you to plan your meals and see the carbon footprint of what you are eating.
    Review our reports and analyze your CO2 reduction target to make more sustainable choices.
